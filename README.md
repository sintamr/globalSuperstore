## üìå Project Title
Sales Performance Dashboard for Global Superstore

## üßë‚Äçüíº User Story
As a Regional Sales Manager, I want an interactive dashboard that provides insights into sales performance, profitability, and shipping efficiency by region, product category, and time. This will help me identify underperforming areas and make informed business decisions to improve profitability.

## üéØ Project Objectives
1. Provide an overview of sales and profit performance.
2. Analyze sales and profit trends over time (monthly/quarterly).
3. Present geographical performance by region and state.
4. Visualize shipping performance and delivery times.
5. Enable interactive exploration for stakeholders and decision-makers.

## üì¶ Dataset Overview
**Dataset Name**: Global Superstore

**Source**: Sample dataset provided by Tableau

**Key Fields**:
- Order ID, Order Date, Ship Date
- Customer ID, Segment
- Region, Country, State
- Product Category, Sub-Category
- Sales, Quantity, Discount, Profit
- Ship Mode

## üß© Project Requirements
1. Functional Requirements
   The dashboard must:
   - Display key metrics: Total Sales, Total Profit, Quantity Sold.
   - Include filters by: Year, Region, or anything else relevant for the analysis.
   - Break down performance by Category and Sub-Category.

2. Non-Functional Requirements
   The dashboard should:
   - Be responsive and fast.
   - Be intuitive and user-friendly for non-technical users.
   - Follow consistent design and color themes.
  
## üß† Key Business Questions to Answer
1. Which regions generate the most profit?
2. Are there any sub-categories operating at a loss?
3. What are the year-over-year sales trends?
4. How does discounting impact profitability?
5. Are there significant differences in performance between customer segments?

## üìà Project Deliverables
1. Tableau Workbook (.twbx)
2. Interactive Dashboard (Published to Tableau Public or Tableau Server)
3. Insight Report (Key findings from analysis)

## Visualization

**Trend Sales 2014**
<p align="center">
  <img src="Images/Trend Sales.PNG" width="869"><br>
</p>
The 2014 Trend Sales chart illustrates a dynamic sales pattern throughout the year, with several notable fluctuations that reflect seasonal consumer behavior. However, overall, the graph shows a generally upward trend with relatively mild volatility, indicating steady growth over time. The lowest sales were recorded in February (20,284), followed by a significant increase that peaked in November (112,326), likely driven by the year-end shopping season. Although there was a slight decline in December, sales remained high. This pattern highlights consistent growth and suggests strong potential to optimize sales strategies during key periods such as the end of the year.

**Profit by Region and Category**
<p align="center">
  <img src="Images/Profit by Region and Category.PNG" width="869"><br>
</p>
The West region recorded the highest overall profit, driven by strong performance in the Office Supplies and Technology categories. In contrast, the two regions with the lowest profits is Central and South that both incurred losses in the Furniture category. This suggests a consistent issue with Furniture in these areas. Further analysis is needed to identify the underlying causes of these losses, such as low market demand in those regions, ineffective discount strategies, or other operational factors that directly contribute to the losses in the Furniture category within these regions.

**Profit by Subcategory - Central Region**
<p align="center">
  <img src="Images/Profit by Subcategory - Central Region.PNG" width="869"><br>
  <img src="Images/Profit by Subcategory - Central Region.PNG" width="869"><br>
</p>
As a continuation of the finding that the Furniture category experienced losses in the Central and South regions, this chart highlights that sub-categories in the Central region‚Äîsuch as Tables (-2,163), Furnishings (-1,320), and Bookcases (-511) this contributed most significantly to the losses within the category. The largest loss came from the Tables sub-category, which may indicate underlying issues related to the product itself or the sales strategy for that line. Additionally, in the Office Supplies category, although it remains profitable overall, there is a notable loss in the Binders sub-category (-3,957), which exceeds the total losses across all Furniture sub-categories. This suggests that despite a healthy appearance at the category level, there may be hidden losses in certain sub-categories that could be weighing down overall profitability. Meanwhile, the Technology category is performing strongly, with Phones (4,120) and Accessories (2,941) emerging as the top profit contributors. This indicates an opportunity to shift sales or promotional focus toward technology products, particularly in regions struggling with losses in Furniture.

**Based on these insights, the following actions are recommended:**
1. Conduct a thorough review of pricing, offers, and inventory strategies for the Tables, Chairs, and Binders sub-categories.
2. Evaluate the effectiveness of promotions involving underperforming products.
3. Increase the allocation of promotional efforts or resources toward high-performing sub-categories such as Phones and Accessories, especially in regions with lower profitability.

**Effect of Discount Rates on Profitability in Sub-category (Table)**
<p align="center">
  <img src="Images/Effect of Discount Rates on Profitability in Sub-category (Table).PNG" width="869"><br>
</p>
As a follow-up analysis on the Tables sub-category, this chart illustrates a clear negative correlation between discount rates and profitability. When no discount (0%) is applied, Tables still achieve a positive profit of 373. However, at a 20% discount, profit drops sharply to -909, and with a 50% discount, losses deepen to -1,627. This steep decline suggests that aggressive discounting strategies are counterproductive for the Tables sub-category. Instead of boosting sales, high discounts appear insufficient to offset the reduced margins, directly impacting overall profitability.

**Recommendations:**
1. Reevaluate the discounting strategy for Tables. High discounts should be scrutinized to determine whether they truly drive volume or simply erode margins.
2. Experiment with lower discount levels, paired with other tactics such as product bundling, upselling, or loyalty-based offers.
3. Apply customer segmentation to tailor discounts only to price-sensitive segments, rather than offering blanket reductions.

**High Discount Rates on Furniture and Office Supplies in the Central Region**
<p align="center">
  <img src="Images/Discount by Region and Category.PNG" width="869"><br>
</p>
The Discount by Region and Category chart shows that in the Central region, both Furniture and Office Supplies categories receive average discount rates above the overall average threshold. In particular, Furniture holds the highest average discount, followed by Office Supplies, while the Technology category receives the lowest. This condition reinforces the assumption that overly aggressive discount strategies for Furniture and Office Supplies are a key factor in reducing profitability, especially evident in sub-categories like Tables and Binders, which record significant losses.


**Customer Segment Distribution (Central Region) : Focus on Home Office**
<p align="center">
  <img src="Images/Proportion Segment (Central).PNG" width="869"><br>
</p>
The Proportion Segment chart reveals that the Home Office segment accounts for the largest portion of customers in the Central region, representing 48.72%, followed by Consumer (39.48%) and Corporate (11.80%). The dominance of the Home Office segment has important implications for business strategy. This segment typically consists of individuals or small business owners who are more price-sensitive and exhibit purchasing behaviors that differ from corporate clients. Therefore, promotional and discount strategies should be tailored to better align with the preferences and needs of Home Office customers. For example, while aggressive discounts may boost sales volume, they can also negatively impact profitability‚Äîas seen in categories like Furniture and Office Supplies‚Äîif not supported by healthy profit margins. A more sustainable approach would be to target promotions toward high-margin products or sub-categories with proven profitability, while continuously evaluating discount effectiveness within this segment.
Additionally, communication strategies can be personalized for the Home Office audience by highlighting product benefits such as functionality, space efficiency, or flexibility‚Äîfeatures that typically resonate more with this group.
